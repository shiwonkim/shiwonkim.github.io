  <p>
    I am an AI researcher with primary interests in developing scalable and data-efficient learning systems, particularly for applications in medical imaging. 
    My work focuses on learning from evolving and limited (scarce or privacy-sensitive) data conditions that are common in real-world scenarios but remain challenging for deep learning models.
